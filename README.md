# Insightface-Face-Recognition

This project is a face recognition project using InsightFace algorithms.

InsightFace is an open source 2D&3D deep face analysis toolbox, mainly based on PyTorch and MXNet.

In this repo, we will use the R50 Model, one of the InsightFace algorithms. You can download the model [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FPldzmZ6jHfaC-R-jLkxvQRP-cLgxjCT/view)
